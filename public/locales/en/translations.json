        "answers": [
          "Heroic is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0. This is a copyleft license, which means that users are free to use, modify, and distribute the app as they see fit, as long as they follow the terms of the license. In particular, any modified version of the app must also be released under the same license, and must include a copy of the license. Therefore, if you make a fork of Heroic and sell it, you must also release the source code for your modified version under the same license, and make it available to others for free. You are also not allowed to use the Heroic name or branding for your fork without permission."
